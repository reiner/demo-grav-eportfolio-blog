Do you want to automatically sync your site pages to a Git repository (i.e. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)? Run the setup wizard for the [GitSync Plugin](../../admin/plugins/git-sync) and follow the provided instructions.

**Why sync your blog or eportfolio to a Git repository? Glad you asked!**
1. Automatically create versioned backups of each site page/post
2. You can copy (i.e. clone) a copy of your site content using GitHub Desktop and edit your pages using the desktop editor of your choice. You can even do this on an iPad using [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)
3. You can invite other people to contribute to, and collaborate on, your site pages/posts
